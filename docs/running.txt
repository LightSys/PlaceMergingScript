If you want to download the latest OpenStreetMap and NGA data and combine them into one .osm file, run the following command:
`./fetchAndCombinePopPlace.sh`

It will output a file called PopPlaces.osm. It has to be executable for you to run it (try `chmod +x fetchAndCombinePopPlace.sh` if you have issues with that).

This file has two dependencies that should have been distributed with it. They should be in the same directory:
* osmconvert64, which you can download from http://m.m.i24.cc/osmconvert64
* gns2osm.pl, which is a modified version of an earlier gns2osm.pl (see the file for more info)

It also uses these Linux tools:
* wget
* unzip
* perl

fetchAndCombinePopPlace.sh will take quite a while to run because it is running several difficult queries and downloading the results. If you would like to just run a test that will finish more quickly, there is also a ./fetchAndCombinePopPlaceTest.sh which does the same thing, but only gets data for Taiwan.

If you're curious how either of them work, just open it in your favorite text editor. They are both simple bash scripts.
