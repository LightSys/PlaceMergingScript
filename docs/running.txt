If you want to download the latest Openstreetmap and NGA data and combine them into one .osm file, run the following command.
./fetchAndCombinePopPlace.sh

This file depends on having the osmconvert64 file in the same directory. If it isn't there, you can download it from here http://m.m.i24.cc/osmconvert64
It also depends on the gns2osm.pl file, which we mostly got from another source but modified for this specific purpose.
./fetchAndCombinePopPlace.sh will take quite a while to run because it is running several difficult queries and downloading the results. If your curious how it works just open it in your favorite text editor.
.There is also a ./fetchAndCombinePopPlace.sh which does the same thing, but only gets the data for Israel. It is nice to have around for testing since it runs quickly.
