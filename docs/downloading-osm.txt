If you want to download the latest Openstreetmap data on populated places, you can type this command:
./getOsm.sh

This file depends on having the osmconvert64 file in the same directory. If it isn't there, you can download it from here http://m.m.i24.cc/osmconvert64
getOsm.sh will take quite a while to run because it is running several difficult queries and downloading the results. If your curious how it works just open it in your favorite text editor.
There is also a ./getOsmTest.sh which does the same thing, but only gets the data for Israel. It is nice to have around for testing since it runs quickly.
